# Implementation-of-an-NLP-Application-Using-OpenACC-CUDA-Python-and-CUDA-C
This project focuses on optimizing a Natural Language Processing (NLP) pipeline by parallelizing computationally intensive tasks using GPU programming techniques. The application was implemented using three models: OpenACC, CUDA Python, and CUDA C, and evaluated for their effectiveness in enhancing performance.
